## Final Notes

With no prior coding experience I am incredibly suprised and excited about the amount of knowledge gained throughout this course. It is a real testament to the teaching skills and assignments given throughout the course. I hope that the reviewing process is as fun it was creating a project with real world value to myself and my company. Thank you!
